        <p>"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Fashion_Week" target="_blank">NYFW</a> can be both amazingly fun & incredibly overwhelming, 
            especially if you&apos;ve never been. Luckily, I&apos;m here to give 
            you an insider&apos;s guide and make your first show a pleasurable 
            experience. By taking my tips and tricks, and following your gut, 
            you&apos;ll have an unforgettable experience!"</p>
        <h2>Getting Tickets & Picking The Shows</h2>

        <p>“If you&apos;re lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price tag. 
            But I wasn&apos;t so lucky or connected my first 2 years so I&apos;m here to help 
            you out. First, plan out which shows are most important to you and make a 
            schedule and this is a biggie: SET A BUDGET. If you&apos;re worrying about 
            blowing your cash the whole time you won&apos;t have fun. Then check out prices, 
            days, and times and prioritize the designers you want to see most. Lastly, 
            purchase your tickets and get excited!”</p>
        <h2>Dressing for The Shows</h2>

        <p>“Always be true to your own sense of style, if you don&apos;t you&apos;ll be 
            uncomfortable the whole time and it will show. Remember, NYFW is about 
            expressing yourself and taking in what the designers have chosen to 
            express through their new lines. Also it&apos;s important to wear shoes 
            you&apos;ll be comfortable in all day. Obviously you want to look good, 
            but you&apos;ll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.”</p>
